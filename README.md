# CSI4124-Modelling-and-Simulation

Modelling and simulation for a parallel server and queuing system. This software can be run using different permuations of configurations to simulate what the ideal server configuration is with limited resources.

This was done as the term project for CSI 4124 at the University of Ottawa (Modelling and Simulation Theory)

This class focused on analyzing, modelling and simulating different systems and identifying bottlenecks associated with different solutions and correcting issues to optimize for various system metrics.
